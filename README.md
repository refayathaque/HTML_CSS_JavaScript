# HTML_CSS_JavaScript
Primarily FreeCodeCamp &amp; Codecademy Notes

I decided today (March 26, 2017) to start learning JavaScript. I feel confident in my exposure to Ruby thus far, Ruby is a great language for absolute beginners like myself, and I took away more than I could have ever imagined.

*** April 1, 2017 - Haven't been able to get to JavaScript yet. Still doing FreeCodeCamp's HTML, CSS, Bootstrap, and jQuery coursework.
