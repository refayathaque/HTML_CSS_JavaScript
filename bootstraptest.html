      family business, both Jamie's father and grandfather
      were stockbrokers.

      friend of the company, and Jamie's mentor. He works as
      Sandy's assistant at American Express.</h6></li>
      <li><h6>1986: Jamie follows Sandy out of American Express
      to the consumer lending company Commercial Credit Company.
      Jamie was Sandy's right-hand man at Commercial Credit,and
